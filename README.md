# sharedproject

Proposal:

Design and deploy and "Interactive Front-End Application" 
With the use of two seperate API's we intend to provide a one stop site for Movie viewers. 

The site will provide a search for Actors, Movies, Genre and other parameters

When the user makes a search choice the site will then provide a search result of multiple links to where they can watch their selection.

the site will save search results and movies watched for the user locally.
